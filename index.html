  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a software engineer that's transitioning from marketing into computer science. I have an honours diploma in Business Administration - Marketing and over three years of experience leading marketing and web projects in my roles as Marketing Coordinator. I'm currently perusing a Computer Programming diploma at Humber College.</p>

  <h3>My Projects</h3>

  
  <div class="project-header">
    <h4>Super Spy Cam</h4>

  </div>
  <div class="project-details" style="display: none;">
    <p>I built a personal project, <b>Super Spy Cam</b>. It’s a motion-triggered surveillance system written in Python that uses a webcam to monitor your doorway, record video once it detects movement, and sends real-time alerts (with video attachments) to a Discord channel using the official Discord HTTP API. It also includes a lightweight HTTP server to browse the captured footage from your local browser. 
    <br>
    I built this project after a package was stolen from outside my apartment. My plan is to mount a webcam behind the peephole of my front door and connect it to a spare computer (which will run this app).</p>

    <p>Technologies Used:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Language:</b> Python 3</li>
      <li><b>Camera Input:</b> cv2.VideoCapture() from OpenCV</li>
      <li><b>Video Encoding:</b> OpenCV cv2.VideoWriter</li>
      <li><b>Discord Integration:</b> Python requests library using Discord Bot Token & Channel API</li>
      <li><b>Web Server:</b> Python http.server module via HTTPServer and BaseHTTPRequestHandler</li>
      <li><b>Frontend:</b> HTML, JavaScript (fetch API), JSON</li>
      <li><b>Filesystem:</b> Python os, datetime, and json modules  for file naming, lookup, and timestamp formatting</li>
    </ul>
</div>

  <div class="project-header">
    <h4>Storage Assignment</h4>
    <button class="toggle-details">Read more</button>
  </div>
  <div class="project-details" style="display: none;">
    <p>I built a small interactive webpage named <b>Storage Assignment</b>, as part of my first-semester Web Programming and Design course at Humber College. The goal of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of DOM manipulation and browser storage using JavaScript. 
    <br>
    The app allows users to enter their name, save it using localStorage, and receive a personalized greeting that will stay on the page after the page is refreshed. Users can also clear the saved name with a click. As a bonus feature, the project displays a friendly message based on the current day of the week and time of day using JavaScript’s Date object.
